      <v-layout row>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">Iron Orange was created with the intention of forming a tight-knit group of adult gamers who want to team up & finish Destiny bounties, strikes, nightfalls, raids & PvP without getting chewed out for having to deal with real life.</blockquote>

      <v-layout row>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">Patience and efficiency are our lifeblood, and we promote a judgment-free gaming environment. While we will be competitive and are strong players individually, Iron Orange members are truly elite. We might not always be elite in Destiny, but we’re each elite in our own ways, including parenthood, our careers & other parts of reality. Most of us are well-versed in diaper changing & that might occasionally pull us away from a gaming session, but we always come back to hunting down enemy forces.</blockquote>

We’re all here to have a great time stomping the enemy into a greasy pulp, so don’t ruin that blood-lust buzz by trash talking your clan mates. If you have an issue with another member, take it to a direct message or talk to an admin about the problem.</blockquote>

It doesn’t do you any good to just float solo in orbit sporting the clan tag if you don’t hang with the clan. We’re actually here to play this game together. If you go missing for a couple of months, you may be removed from the clan. We’ll welcome you back in the future, but the re-initiation will be brutal. That includes participation in our Discord server.</blockquote>

Be aware that not all of us are interested in playing with your kids. Just make sure that your kids are welcome in a fireteam before they jump in and make us all look like a bunch of newbs. And for the love of all that is holy, keep them away from your Discord account.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">If it hinders another player, don’t do it. If it’s harmless, and makes the grind a little softer, then ok. Try it the right way and then cheese only if you must, but try to make it happen the way it was meant to happen. If your cheese is funking up the game for other players (IO or not), then don’t do it.</blockquote>

        <strong>Tea-bagging</strong>

      <v-layout>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">is a time honored tradition among gamers, and dropping your spongy satchel on an opponent (or an occasional team member) is a gratifying release of frustration and a demeaning display of superiority. We do not ask that you refrain from tea-bagging, but please only tea-bag after being tea-bagged upon. When possible, team-bag; a team-bag is just a show of solidarity and perfectly legit team building exercise.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">We get it. You are a bad-ass mofo — just don’t bring your swagger in here. If you want to find help for a raid, strike, whatever, don’t set any type of requirements or restrictions that prevent members joining your group. If you are miles ahead of the clan in level, expect to be a sherpa during the time it takes the rest of us to catch up. The point of this clan is to raise the abilities and of us all as a group.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">LFG is a perk of this clan and not the reason for the clan’s existence. There are a lot of methods for finding other random people to group up with, so if that’s your goal, ask an admin to point you in the right direction. LFG exists in IO because we want to play with other like-minded dudes in a judgement-free zone.</blockquote>

Don’t freak out if you can’t find a team. Be patient or try helping another member with something until your team fills up. Hell, make plans ahead of time. If your surfing Discord at work and want to raid that night, then set it up ahead of time so that the team is ready when you get online.</blockquote>
